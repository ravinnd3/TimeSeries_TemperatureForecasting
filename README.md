**1. Introduction
   
Accurate temperature forecasting is essential for agriculture, energy management, and climate analysis. With the advancement of data science and machine learning, both statistical and neural network-based models have become powerful tools for time series forecasting. This project aims to develop and evaluate multiple forecasting models using historical temperature data obtained from Kaggle, leveraging both classical and deep learning approaches.
